# Sequential Mass URL Opener
Chrome extension that opens each URL in list into tabs in a window, but only if prior pages have finished loading.

See [Releases](https://github.com/Lemonsavery/openUrlsWhenLoaded/releases) for most recent in-production changes. For old unsupported Chromebooks with old Chrome versions, it *might* still be possible to run this extension, check this [release](https://github.com/Lemonsavery/openUrlsWhenLoaded/releases/tag/x).
